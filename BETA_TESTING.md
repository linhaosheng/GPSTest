# Testing GPSTest

We provide early access to new versions of GPSTest via Google Play's [beta testing](https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta) platform. This helps us get feedback on bug fixes and new features before they are distributed to all users.

Please note that these versions are not as heavily tested as production releases and, as a result, may not be as stable.

## Register as a beta tester

1. Go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.android.gpstest and opt in for testing
1. Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.gpstest) (using the same Google account) - you'll now have access to the beta version!

Please be patient - it may take a few hours for the beta version to become available after you opt in.  You only have to complete the above steps once. Unless you opt-out (using the same link in #1 above), you'll continue to receive new beta versions as they are released.

Please note that you need to use the same Google account for both steps above, or you won't get access to the beta.

Note that as a beta tester you'll automatically get production releases too.

## How to provide feedback

Please let us know if you experience problems with a beta, or would like to give general feedback (good and bad)!

If the app crashes, please submit a crash report when you are prompted, and add comments on what you were doing when it crashed.  This gives us the information we need to fix problems.
